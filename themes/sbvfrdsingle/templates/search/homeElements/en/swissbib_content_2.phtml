    <h2 class="lead">Search filters improved</h2>
    <p>The behaviour of the search filters has been refactored. You now have the possibility to exclude terms as well.
        Exclude undesired terms by clicking on the little cross on the right hand side of the term.</p>
    <p>Subjects are linked by AND, the terms in all the other filters are linked with OR.
        The chosen terms or exclucions and the operators between are shown in the section "remove filters".
